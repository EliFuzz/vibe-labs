Who are the target users (age, role, location, etc.)?\n2. What is their professional and personal context?\n3. What technology do they currently use?\n4. What are their communication preferences?\n\n### User Behavior & Needs\n\n5. What problems are users trying to solve?\n6. How do they currently address these problems?\n7. What are their main goals and motivations?\n8. What frustrates them about current solutions?\n\n### Usage Context\n\n9. When and where would they use this product?\n10. What constraints do they face (time, budget, technical)?\n11. Who else is involved in their decision-making?\n12. What would success look like for them?\n\n### Research Validation\n\n13. What user research has been conducted?\n14. How many users were interviewed/surveyed?\n15. What were the key findings and insights?\n16. What assumptions need further validation?\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n### Research Pitfalls\n\n- **Assumption-based personas**: Creating personas without user research\n- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeking data that confirms existing beliefs\n- **Small sample sizes**: Drawing conclusions from insufficient data\n- **Leading questions**: Biasing research participants toward desired answers\n- **Outdated research**: Using old data that doesn't reflect current users\n\n### Persona Pitfalls\n\n- **Generic personas**: Creating vague, non-actionable user descriptions\n- **Stereotype reinforcement**: Relying on assumptions rather than research\n- **Too many personas**: Creating so many personas that they become unusable\n- **Demographic focus**: Overemphasizing demographics vs. behaviors and needs\n- **Static personas**: Failing to update personas as users evolve\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### Limited User Access\n\n- Use proxy research methods (surveys, analytics)\n- Leverage existing customer support data\n- Conduct competitive user research\n- Use expert interviews and stakeholder insights\n- Plan for iterative research as access improves\n\n### Diverse User Base\n\n- Create primary and secondary personas\n- Focus on shared needs across diverse users\n- Consider accessibility and inclusion requirements\n- Plan for localization and cultural differences\n- Use behavioral segmentation over demographic\n\n### B2B vs B2C Considerations\n\n- **B2B**: Include organizational context, decision-making processes, stakeholder influence\n- **B2C**: Focus on personal motivations, lifestyle factors, emotional drivers\n- **Both**: Consider the full ecosystem of users and influencers\n\n### Emerging User Behaviors\n\n- Monitor trends and changing behaviors\n- Plan for user evolution and adaptation\n- Include early adopters and mainstream users\n- Consider generational differences\n- Build flexibility into persona frameworks\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] **Research Foundation**: All insights based on credible user research\n- [ ] **Persona Completeness**: Each persona includes all required elements\n- [ ] **Actionability**: Personas provide clear guidance for product decisions\n- [ ] **Distinctiveness**: Personas represent meaningfully different user types\n- [ ] **Journey Accuracy**: User journeys reflect observed behaviors\n- [ ] **Need Validation**: User needs supported by research evidence\n\n## Output Format\n\nmarkdown\n\n# User Research & Personas\n\n## Research Methodology & Data Sources\n\n[Research methodology content]\n\n## User Segmentation & Classification\n\n[Segmentation analysis content]\n\n## Primary Personas\n\n### [Persona 1 Name]\n\n[Complete persona details]\n\n### [Persona 2 Name]\n\n[Complete persona details]\n\n## User Journey Mapping\n\n[Journey mapping content]\n\n## User Needs & Requirements Analysis\n\n[Needs analysis content]\n\n## Usage Scenarios & Use Cases\n\n[Scenarios and use cases content]\n\n---\n\n_Research conducted: [Date range]_\n_Sample size: [Number of participants]_\n_Next research update: [Planned refresh date]_\n\n## Success Indicators\n\nSuccessful user research and personas should:\n\n- Enable empathetic, user-centered product decisions\n- Provide clear guidance for feature prioritization\n- Support effective user experience design\n- Facilitate stakeholder alignment on user needs\n- Serve as a reference for all product development activities\n"})})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8906:(e,n,s)=>{s.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var t=s(6672);const a={},i=t.createContext(a);function r(e){const n=t.useContext(i);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function o(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:r(e.components),t.createElement(i.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
