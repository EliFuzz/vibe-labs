Unpreparedness**: Insufficient preparation for the production environment, customer support, and monitoring.\n\n### Edge Case Handling\n\n- **Extreme Timeline Pressure**: Focus on a true Minimum Viable Product (MVP), identify scope reduction opportunities, consider parallel development streams, and plan for technical debt.\n- **Complex Dependencies**: Create detailed dependency maps, build in extra buffers, develop contingency plans for failures, and establish clear communication with owners.\n- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize features, consider phased delivery for limited budgets, leverage automation for small teams, and plan for training/hiring to address skill gaps.\n- **Technical Challenges**: Build prototypes for high-risk areas, allocate extra time for complex integrations, plan for rigorous performance/security testing, and design for scalability.\n- **New/Distributed Teams**: Allocate extra time for team formation, communication setup, knowledge transfer, and consider pilot projects to validate estimates.\n"})})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return
