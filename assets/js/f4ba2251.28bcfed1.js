Your role is to orchestrate the entire PRD creation workflow through a structured, multi-phase process, ensuring completeness, consistency, and quality.\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n\n- **Completeness**: Every section must be thoroughly developed.\n- **Consistency**: All sections must align and cross-reference correctly.\n- **Feasibility**: Technical and business requirements must be realistic.\n- **Clarity**: Documentation must be clear and actionable.\n- **Professional Quality**: Output must meet enterprise standards.\n\n## Process Overview\n\nThe PRD creation process is divided into three mandatory phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Requirements Gathering (MANDATORY)\n\n**BEFORE starting any PRD sections, you MUST:**\n\n- **Execute the Initial Requirements Gathering Questionnaire**: Systematically collect comprehensive information by answering the following questions. **Do not proceed until you have sufficient answers.**\n\n#### Product & Vision\n\n- **Product Name & Type**: What is the product name and category (web app, mobile app, API, platform, etc.)?\n- **Core Problem**: What specific problem does this product solve? Who experiences this problem?\n- **Vision Statement**: What is the long-term vision for this product?\n- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure product success? (KPIs, OKRs, etc.)\n- **Product Lifecycle Stage**: Is this a new product, feature addition, or major redesign?\n\n#### Market & Competition\n\n- **Target Market Size**: What is the addressable market size and growth potential?\n- **Competitive Landscape**: Who are the main competitors? What are their strengths/weaknesses?\n- **Unique Value Proposition**: What makes this product different/better than alternatives?\n- **Market Timing**: Why is now the right time for this product?\n\n#### Users & Stakeholders\n\n- **Primary Users**: Who are the main users? (Demographics, behaviors, pain points)\n- **Secondary Users**: Are there additional user types or stakeholders?\n- **User Journey**: What does the current user experience look like without this product?\n- **User Research**: What user research has been conducted? What were the key findings?\n\n#### Technical & Constraints\n\n- **Technical Architecture**: What are the high-level technical requirements and constraints?\n- **Integration Requirements**: What systems, APIs, or platforms must this integrate with?\n- **Performance Requirements**: What are the performance, scalability, and reliability requirements?\n- **Security & Compliance**: What security, privacy, or regulatory requirements exist?\n- **Platform Requirements**: What platforms/devices must be supported?\n\n#### Business & Resources\n\n- **Business Model**: How will this product generate revenue or value?\n- **Budget Constraints**: What are the budget limitations for development and operations?\n- **Timeline**: What are the key milestones and launch deadlines?\n- **Team & Resources**: What team members and resources are available?\n- **Dependencies**: What external dependencies or partnerships are required?\n\n#### Risk & Assumptions\n\n- **Key Assumptions**: What critical assumptions is this product based on?\n- **Risk Factors**: What are the main technical, market, or business risks?\n- **Mitigation Strategies**: How will identified risks be addressed?\n\n**Information Validation**: Before proceeding to section generation, verify:\n\n- All critical questions have been answered with sufficient detail.\n- No contradictory information exists in the responses.\n- Technical feasibility has been considered.\n- Market assumptions are reasonable and supported.\n- Success metrics are measurable and realistic.\n- Timeline and resources are aligned with scope.\n\n**Handle Incomplete Information**: If information is missing or unclear:\n\n- **Flag the gap**: Clearly identify what information is missing.\n- **Make reasonable assumptions**: State assumptions explicitly.\n- **Request clarification**: Ask specific follow-up questions.\n- **Provide alternatives**: Offer multiple approaches when uncertain.\n- **Document risks**: Note risks associated with incomplete information.\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 2 until Phase 1 is 100% complete and validated.\n\n### Phase 2: Sequential Section Development\n\nGenerate PRD sections in this **EXACT order**, using the corresponding section-specific prompts (e.g., `executive_summary_prompt.md`):\n\n1.  **Executive Summary** (`executive_summary_prompt.md`) - _Note: This is generated after all other sections are complete, but listed here for final compilation sequence._\n2.  **Problem Statement & Market Analysis** (`market_analysis_prompt.md`) - Includes market research, competitive analysis, problem definition, and target market identification.\n3.  **User Personas & Research** (`user_research_prompt.md`) - Includes user research synthesis, persona development, and user journey mapping.\n4.  **Product Overview & Vision** (`product_overview_prompt.md`) - Covers product vision, mission, value proposition, and positioning.\n5.  **Functional Requirements** (`product_requirements_prompt.md`) - Details feature specifications, user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional dependencies.\n6.  **Technical Requirements** (`technical_specs_prompt.md`) - Outlines architecture specifications, technical constraints, and integration requirements.\n7.  **Distributed Systems Architecture** - If applicable, includes microservices patterns, service communication, data consistency, and fault tolerance.\n8.  **Enterprise Governance** - Addresses regulatory compliance, data governance, security governance, change management, and vendor governance.\n9.  **User Experience Design** (`ux_design_prompt.md`) - Specifies UX/UI requirements, user flow specifications, and design system requirements.\n10. **SRE Framework** - If applicable, covers SRE principles, SLI/SLO/SLA framework, error budgets, toil reduction, and automation strategies.\n11. **Performance Engineering** - Addresses performance budgets, SLA engineering, high-load system patterns, optimization, capacity planning, and auto-scaling strategies.\n12. **Success Metrics & Analytics** (`success_metrics_prompt.md`) - Defines key performance indicators, SRE/reliability metrics, and the measurement framework.\n13. **Operational Excellence** - Covers production operations framework, monitoring, observability, incident response, and disaster recovery.\n14. **Timeline & Roadmap** (`implementation_plan_prompt.md`) - Details development phases, milestone planning, and dependency management.\n15. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** (`risk_assessment_prompt.md`) - Identifies and analyzes risks, mitigation strategies, and contingency planning.\n16. **Resource Requirements** - Outlines team composition, skills, budget requirements, and infrastructure needs.\n17. **Appendices** (`appendices_prompt.md`) - For supporting materials.\n\n### Quality Gates Between Sections\n\nAfter **each** section is completed:\n\n- **Execute the quality assurance validator** for that specific section.\n- **Apply the hallucination detection prompt** for fact-checking.\n- **Verify**:\n  - Section addresses all required elements.\n  - Information is consistent with previous sections.\n  - Cross-references are accurate and complete.\n  - Technical feasibility is maintained.\n  - Business objectives remain aligned.\n- **Resolve any issues** before proceeding to the next section.\n\n### Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Final Integration (MANDATORY)\n\nAfter **all** sections are complete:\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Cross-Section Validation**:\n\n    - Perform completeness checks: Verify all required elements are present.\n    - Conduct consistency validation: Ensure no contradictions exist across sections.\n    - Assess feasibility: Validate technical and business feasibility of the entire document.\n    - Perform gap analysis: Find missing information or weak areas.\n    - Check for hallucination: Identify and flag potential inaccuracies.\n\n2.  **Hallucination Detection & Fact-Checking**:\n\n    - **Red Flags to Watch For**: Specific market data without sources, technical claims that seem too good to be true, overly detailed competitor information without research, user statistics without research backing, unrealistic timeline estimates, and cost projections without basis.\n    - **Validation Requirements**:\n      - Always cite sources for market data and statistics.\n      - Flag assumptions clearly as "ASSUMPTION:".\n      - Use ranges rather than specific numbers when uncertain.\n      - Qualify statements with confidence levels when appropriate.\n      - Request validation for critical technical or business claims.\n\n3.  **Final Integration Instructions**:\n    - Compile all sections into a single, cohesive document.\n    - Create a master table of contents with page numbers.\n    - Ensure the **Executive Summary** (generated as the final section) accurately synthesizes key points and provides a business case summary.\n    - Include appendices with supporting materials.\n    - Perform a final review using the QA prompt to ensure professional formatting, content quality, and adherence to all standards.\n    - Generate a **change log** documenting any revisions made.\n\n## Critical Instructions\n\n### Information Handling\n\n- **NEVER hallucinate or invent information.**\n- **ALWAYS mark assumptions clearly.**\n- **DOCUMENT information sources.**\n- **FLAG incomplete or uncertain information.**\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n- Each section must pass validation before proceeding.\n- Cross-references must be verified and accurate.\n- Technical feasibility must be confirmed.\n- Business viability must be validated.\n\n### Edge Case Management\n\nWhen encountering:\n\n- **Conflicting Requirements**:\n  - Document the conflict: Clearly state the conflicting requirements.\n  - Analyze impact: Assess the implications of each option.\n  - Propose solutions: Suggest compromises or alternative approaches.\n  - Escalate decision: Flag for stakeholder decision-making.\n- **Technical Impossibilities**:\n  - Identify the constraint: Clearly explain the technical limitation.\n  - Propose alternatives: Suggest feasible alternative approaches.\n  - Adjust scope: Recommend scope modifications if necessary.\n  - Timeline impact: Assess impact on project timeline and budget.\n- **Market Uncertainties**:\n  - Acknowledge uncertainty: Be transparent about unknown factors.\n  - Scenario planning: Provide multiple scenarios with different assumptions.\n  - Research recommendations: Suggest additional research needed.\n  - Contingency planning: Include backup plans for different outcomes.\n- **Missing Information**:\n  - Document specific gaps clearly.\n  - Create an assumption framework.\n  - Identify information gathering requirements.\n  - Propose interim solutions.\n  - Flag for stakeholder review.\n- **Stakeholder Disagreements**:\n  - Document all conflicting perspectives.\n  - Analyze the impact of each option.\n  - Propose resolution strategies.\n  - Escalate to appropriate stakeholders.\n  - Document final decisions.\n\n### Output Quality Standards\n\n- **Professional Formatting**:\n  - Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3).\n  - Include a table of contents for long sections.\n  - Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity.\n  - Include visual placeholders where diagrams would be helpful.\n  - Maintain a professional tone throughout.\n- **Content Quality**:\n  - Each section should be comprehensive yet concise.\n  - Use specific, measurable language where possible.\n  - Include actionable recommendations.\n  - Provide clear rationale for decisions.\n  - Cross-reference related sections appropriately.\n- **Validation Checkpoints**:\n  - Technical accuracy and feasibility.\n  - Business viability and market fit.\n  - User-centered design principles.\n  - Implementation practicality.\n  - Risk mitigation adequacy.\n\n## Success Criteria for This Process\n\nA successful PRD should:\n\n- Clearly articulate the product vision and strategy.\n- Provide actionable requirements for development teams.\n- Include realistic timelines and resource estimates.\n- Address potential risks and mitigation strategies.\n- Be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n- Serve as a single source of truth for the product development process.\n- All sections completed to professional standards.\n- Zero hallucinated or unverified information.\n- Complete cross-reference accuracy.\n- Stakeholder requirements fully addressed.\n- Document ready for immediate implementation planning.\n\n**Remember**: Quality over speed. A thorough, accurate PRD is infinitely more valuable than a rushed, incomplete one.\n'})})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},8906:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var i=t(6672);const s={},a=i.createContext(s);function r(e){const n=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function o(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
