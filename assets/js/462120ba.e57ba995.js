range]\n**Key Mitigation Activities**:\n\n- [Activity 1 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 2 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 3 with owner and deadline]\n\n### Pre-Launch Phase\n\n**Timeline**: [Date range]\n**Key Mitigation Activities**:\n\n- [Activity 1 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 2 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 3 with owner and deadline]\n\n### Post-Launch Phase\n\n**Timeline**: [Date range]\n**Key Mitigation Activities**:\n\n- [Activity 1 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 2 with owner and deadline]\n- [Activity 3 with owner and deadline]\n\n### Ongoing Risk Management\n\n[Continuous activities for risk monitoring and management]\n\n## Information Gathering Requirements\n\n### Risk Context Needed:\n\n- Historical data on similar projects and their risks\n- Team experience and capability assessment\n- Market and competitive intelligence\n- Technical complexity and dependency analysis\n- Stakeholder risk tolerance and preferences\n\n### Validation Requirements:\n\n- Team review and validation of risk assessments\n- Stakeholder alignment on risk priorities\n- Expert review of technical and market risks\n- Stress testing of mitigation strategies\n\n## Cross-Reference Requirements\n\n### Must Reference:\n\n- All technical requirements and dependencies\n- Timeline and resource constraints\n- Success metrics and validation approach\n- Market analysis and competitive landscape\n\n### Must Support:\n\n- Project planning and resource allocation\n- Stakeholder communication and expectation setting\n- Quality assurance and testing strategy\n- Launch planning and go-to-market execution\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n### Risk Identification Pitfalls:\n\n- **Optimism bias**: Underestimating likelihood or impact of risks\n- **Scope limitation**: Only considering obvious or technical risks\n- **Static thinking**: Not considering how risks evolve over time\n- **Blame avoidance**: Not identifying risks due to fear of responsibility\n\n### Risk Assessment Pitfalls:\n\n- **Subjective assessment**: Not using consistent criteria for evaluation\n- **Single point of view**: Not getting diverse perspectives on risks\n- **Historical bias**: Over-relying on past experience without considering context\n- **Impact underestimation**: Not fully considering cascading effects\n\n### Mitigation Pitfalls:\n\n- **Mitigation theater**: Creating mitigation plans that aren't actionable\n- **Over-mitigation**: Spending too much effort on low-priority risks\n- **No ownership**: Not assigning clear responsibility for mitigation\n- **No monitoring**: Not tracking whether mitigation is working\n\n## Edge Case Considerations\n\n### When Risk Tolerance is Low:\n\n- Focus on comprehensive mitigation for all identified risks\n- Build extra buffers and contingencies\n- Plan more frequent risk reviews and updates\n- Consider more conservative technical and market approaches\n\n### When Timeline Pressure is High:\n\n- Focus mitigation on highest-impact risks\n- Accept some risks in favor of speed\n- Plan rapid response capabilities\n- Communicate risk trade-offs clearly to stakeholders\n\n### When Team is Inexperienced:\n\n- Add extra focus on execution and process risks\n- Plan for more mentoring and knowledge transfer\n- Build in extra learning time and iteration cycles\n- Consider external expertise for high-risk areas\n\n## Validation Checkpoints\n\n### Before Finalizing Section:\n\n- [ ] All major risk categories have been considered\n- [ ] Risk assessments are realistic and evidence-based\n- [ ] Mitigation strategies are actionable and well-planned\n- [ ] Risk ownership is clear and appropriate\n- [ ] Contingency plans are practical and detailed\n\n### Cross-Section
