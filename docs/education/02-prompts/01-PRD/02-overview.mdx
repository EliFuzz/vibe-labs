## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. Choose your AI assistant (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)
2. Start with the **Master PRD Orchestrator** prompt
3. Gather initial product information using the pre-generation questionnaire

### Step 2: Section Generation

1. Use section-specific prompts in the recommended order:
   - Executive Summary (last, after all other sections)
   - Product Overview
   - Market Analysis
   - User Research & Personas
   - Product Requirements
   - Technical Specifications
   - UX Design
   - Implementation Plan

### Step 3: Quality Assurance

1. Use the Quality Assurance prompt to validate the complete PRD
2. Address any identified issues or gaps
3. Iterate until quality standards are met

### Step 4: Final Integration

1. Combine all sections into a cohesive document
2. Ensure consistent formatting and cross-references
3. Prepare for stakeholder review and approval

## Detailed Usage Instructions

### Using the Master Orchestrator

The **Master PRD Orchestrator** (`master_prd_orchestrator.md`) should be your starting point. It:

- Guides you through initial requirements gathering
- Provides a comprehensive questionnaire covering all aspects
- Defines the sequence for using section-specific prompts
- Includes quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Handles edge cases and incomplete information

**Best Practices:**

- Complete the pre-generation questionnaire thoroughly
- Don't skip sections even if information seems limited
- Use the fallback strategies for incomplete information
- Follow the recommended section sequence

### Section-Specific Prompt Usage

Each section prompt is designed to be used independently but builds on information from previous sections:

- **Requires**: All completed PRD sections
- **Outputs**: Concise executive overview, business case, key highlights
- **Next step**: Quality Assurance

### Quality Assurance Process

The **Quality Assurance prompt** (`quality_assurance_prompt.md`) provides comprehensive validation:

#### What It Checks:

- **Completeness**: All required sections and information present
- **Consistency**: Information aligns across sections without contradictions
- **Feasibility**: Requirements and plans are realistic and achievable
- **Quality**: Content meets professional standards and best practices
- **Accuracy**: Information is factual and free from hallucinations
- **Clarity**: Content is clear, specific, and actionable

#### How to Use:

1. Run the QA prompt after completing all sections
2. Review the generated quality assessment report
3. Address critical issues immediately
4. Implement recommended improvements
5. Re-run QA validation if significant changes were made

#### Quality Thresholds:

- **25-30/30**: Excellent - Ready for stakeholder review
- **20-24/30**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **15-19/30**: Fair - Significant improvements required
- **10-14/30**: Poor - Major revisions needed
- **Below 10/30**: Unacceptable - Requires substantial rework

## AI Platform Compatibility

This prompt system is designed to work across different AI platforms:

### Tested Platforms:

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Excellent performance, handles complex instructions well
- **GPT-4 (OpenAI)**: Strong performance, good at following structured prompts
- **Gemini (Google)**: Good performance, effective for research-heavy sections
- **Other LLMs**: Should work with any sufficiently capable language model

### Platform-Specific Tips:

#### For Claude:

- Excellent at following complex, structured prompts
- Strong at maintaining consistency across sections
- Good at identifying potential issues and hallucinations

#### For GPT-4:

- Works well with clear, specific instructions
- May need reminders about cross-section consistency
- Strong at creative problem-solving and edge cases

#### For Gemini:

- Excellent for research and market analysis sections
- Good at factual accuracy and source validation
- May need guidance on maintaining consistent tone

## Best Practices

### Information Gathering

- **Be Thorough**: Complete questionnaires fully, even if some information is uncertain
- **Use Real Data**: Provide actual market research, user feedback, and business data when available
- **Document Sources**: Keep track of information sources for validation and updates
- **Iterate**: Don't expect perfection on the first pass - plan for multiple iterations

### Section Development

- **Follow Sequence**: Use sections in the recommended order for best results
- **Cross-Reference**: Regularly check that new sections align with previous ones
- **Validate Assumptions**: Question and verify any assumptions made by the AI
- **Maintain Focus**: Keep each section focused on its specific purpose and scope

### Quality Management

- **Regular Validation**: Run quality checks after completing each major section
- **Address Issues Early**: Fix problems as they're identified rather than waiting
- **Stakeholder Review**: Get feedback from relevant stakeholders during development
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and iterations

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Information Overload**: Don't try to include everything - focus on what's essential
- **Inconsistent Detail**: Maintain similar levels of detail across sections
- **Assumption Creep**: Regularly validate that AI isn't making unsupported assumptions
- **Generic Content**: Push for specific, actionable content rather than generic advice

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "AI is generating generic content"

**Solution**: Provide more specific context and examples. Use follow-up prompts to drill down into details.

#### "Sections are inconsistent with each other"

**Solution**: Use the cross-reference validation in each prompt. Run quality assurance more frequently.

#### "Technical specifications seem unrealistic"

**Solution**: Validate technical assumptions with your development team. Provide more context about technical constraints.

#### "Market analysis contains questionable data"

**Solution**: Fact-check all market data. Provide specific, credible sources. Use the hallucination detection guidelines.

#### "Implementation timeline seems too optimistic"

**Solution**: Provide more detail about team capabilities and constraints. Include buffer time and risk factors.

### Getting Better Results

#### Provide Context

- Share relevant background information
- Explain constraints and limitations
- Describe your team and organizational context

#### Be Specific

- Ask for specific examples and details
- Request quantified metrics and targets
- Specify format and length requirements
