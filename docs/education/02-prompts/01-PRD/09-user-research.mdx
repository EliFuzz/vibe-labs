## Information Gathering Questions

If user research data is missing, ask:

### User Demographics & Context

1. Who are the target users (age, role, location, etc.)?
2. What is their professional and personal context?
3. What technology do they currently use?
4. What are their communication preferences?

### User Behavior & Needs

5. What problems are users trying to solve?
6. How do they currently address these problems?
7. What are their main goals and motivations?
8. What frustrates them about current solutions?

### Usage Context

9. When and where would they use this product?
10. What constraints do they face (time, budget, technical)?
11. Who else is involved in their decision-making?
12. What would success look like for them?

### Research Validation

13. What user research has been conducted?
14. How many users were interviewed/surveyed?
15. What were the key findings and insights?
16. What assumptions need further validation?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Research Pitfalls

- **Assumption-based personas**: Creating personas without user research
- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeking data that confirms existing beliefs
- **Small sample sizes**: Drawing conclusions from insufficient data
- **Leading questions**: Biasing research participants toward desired answers
- **Outdated research**: Using old data that doesn't reflect current users

### Persona Pitfalls

- **Generic personas**: Creating vague, non-actionable user descriptions
- **Stereotype reinforcement**: Relying on assumptions rather than research
- **Too many personas**: Creating so many personas that they become unusable
- **Demographic focus**: Overemphasizing demographics vs. behaviors and needs
- **Static personas**: Failing to update personas as users evolve

## Edge Case Handling

### Limited User Access

- Use proxy research methods (surveys, analytics)
- Leverage existing customer support data
- Conduct competitive user research
- Use expert interviews and stakeholder insights
- Plan for iterative research as access improves

### Diverse User Base

- Create primary and secondary personas
- Focus on shared needs across diverse users
- Consider accessibility and inclusion requirements
- Plan for localization and cultural differences
- Use behavioral segmentation over demographic

### B2B vs B2C Considerations

- **B2B**: Include organizational context, decision-making processes, stakeholder influence
- **B2C**: Focus on personal motivations, lifestyle factors, emotional drivers
- **Both**: Consider the full ecosystem of users and influencers

### Emerging User Behaviors

- Monitor trends and changing behaviors
- Plan for user evolution and adaptation
- Include early adopters and mainstream users
- Consider generational differences
- Build flexibility into persona frameworks

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] **Research Foundation**: All insights based on credible user research
- [ ] **Persona Completeness**: Each persona includes all required elements
- [ ] **Actionability**: Personas provide clear guidance for product decisions
- [ ] **Distinctiveness**: Personas represent meaningfully different user types
- [ ] **Journey Accuracy**: User journeys reflect observed behaviors
