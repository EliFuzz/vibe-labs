### 4. Integration Requirements

**Objective**: Define how product integrates with external systems

**Required Elements:**

- **Integration Overview**: Summary of all required integrations
- **API Requirements**: Specifications for APIs that must be consumed or provided
- **Data Exchange Requirements**: What data needs to be exchanged and how
- **Authentication Requirements**: How integrations will be secured
- **Performance Requirements**: Performance expectations for integrations
- **Error Handling Requirements**: How integration failures will be handled

### 5. Data Requirements

**Objective**: Specify data needs and management requirements

**Required Elements:**

- **Data Model**: Key data entities and relationships
- **Data Sources**: Where data comes from
- **Data Quality Requirements**: Standards for data accuracy and completeness
- **Data Retention Requirements**: How long data must be kept
- **Data Privacy Requirements**: Privacy and protection requirements
- **Data Migration Requirements**: How existing data will be migrated

### 6. Business Rules and Logic

**Objective**: Define business rules that govern product behavior

**Required Elements:**

- **Business Rules Catalog**: All business rules that apply
- **Rule Priorities**: How conflicting rules are resolved
- **Rule Exceptions**: When and how rules can be overridden
- **Rule Validation**: How rules are validated and enforced
- **Rule Changes**: How business rules can be modified

## Information Gathering Requirements

### Functional Context Needed:

- User workflows and processes
- Business rules and constraints
- Integration requirements and constraints
- Data requirements and sources
- Performance and scalability needs

### Validation Requirements:

- User validation of requirements and user stories
- Technical validation of feasibility
- Business validation of value and priority
- Stakeholder review and approval

## Cross-Reference Requirements

### Must Reference:

- User personas and their goals
- Product vision and value proposition
- Technical constraints and capabilities
- Business objectives and success criteria

### Must Support:

- Technical architecture decisions
- User experience design
- Testing and quality assurance plans
- Implementation planning and estimation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Requirements Definition Pitfalls:

- **Solution specification**: Specifying how instead of what
- **Requirement inflation**: Adding unnecessary complexity
- **Ambiguous language**: Using vague or interpretable terms
- **Missing edge cases**: Not considering error conditions and exceptions

### User Story Pitfalls:

- **Technical user stories**: Writing stories from system perspective
- **Epic user stories**: Stories that are too large to implement
- **Missing acceptance criteria**: Not defining how to test the story
- **Persona mismatch**: Stories that don't match defined personas

### Prioritization Pitfalls:

- **Everything is high priority**: Not making hard prioritization decisions
- **Feature bias**: Prioritizing features over user value
- **Technical debt ignorance**: Not accounting for technical requirements
- **Stakeholder politics**: Letting politics drive prioritization

## Edge Case Considerations

### When Requirements are Uncertain:

- Use assumption-driven development approach
- Plan for rapid validation and iteration
- Build flexibility into architecture
- Document uncertainty and validation plans

### When Users Have Conflicting Needs:

- Prioritize based on business value and user impact
- Consider configurable solutions
- Plan phased approach to address different needs
- Document trade-offs and decisions

### When Technical Constraints Limit Requirements:

- Work with technical team to understand constraints
- Identify alternative approaches to meet user needs
- Plan technical debt reduction to enable future requirements
- Document constraints and their impact
