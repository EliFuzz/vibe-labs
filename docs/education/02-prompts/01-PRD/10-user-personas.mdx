## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Persona Development Pitfalls:

- **Assumption-based personas**: Creating personas without research
- **Stereotype personas**: Using clich√©s instead of real insights
- **Too many personas**: Creating so many they become unusable
- **Static personas**: Not updating personas as you learn more

### Research Pitfalls:

- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeing data that confirms assumptions
- **Small sample bias**: Drawing conclusions from too few users
- **Vocal minority**: Overweighting feedback from loudest users
- **Research theater**: Doing research but not using insights

### Journey Mapping Pitfalls:

- **Linear thinking**: Assuming users follow predictable paths
- **Internal perspective**: Mapping company processes, not user reality
- **Missing emotions**: Focusing only on actions, not feelings
- **Static journeys**: Not accounting for journey evolution

## Edge Case Considerations

### When User Research is Limited:

- Use proxy research from similar products/markets
- Leverage internal stakeholder knowledge
- Create assumption-based personas with validation plan
- Plan primary research to validate assumptions

### When Users are Diverse:

- Focus on primary use cases and users
- Create persona variants rather than separate personas
- Document diversity within personas
- Prioritize based on business impact

### When Users are Experts:

- Include detailed technical context
- Map complex workflows and decision processes
- Account for high expectations and standards
- Include peer influence and community factors

## Validation Checkpoints
