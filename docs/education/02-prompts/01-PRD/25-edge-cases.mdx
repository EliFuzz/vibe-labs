# Edge Cases

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive guidance for handling edge cases, conflicts, and unusual situations that may arise during PRD development. This handbook ensures consistent, thoughtful resolution of complex scenarios.

## Conflict Resolution Framework

### 1. Stakeholder Conflicts

**Common Scenarios:**

- Different stakeholders have conflicting requirements
- Business objectives conflict with user needs
- Technical constraints conflict with business timeline
- Budget limitations conflict with scope expectations

**Resolution Process:**

1. **Document All Perspectives**: Capture each stakeholder's position and rationale
2. **Identify Root Causes**: Understand underlying concerns and motivations
3. **Analyze Impact**: Assess consequences of each approach
4. **Propose Solutions**: Develop options that address core concerns
5. **Facilitate Decision**: Guide stakeholders to consensus or escalate appropriately

- Plan iterative validation of technical assumptions

## Resource and Timeline Constraints

### 1. Severe Budget Limitations

**Strategies for Budget Constraints:**

- Focus ruthlessly on MVP and core value proposition

### 2. Aggressive Timeline Pressure

**Strategies for Timeline Pressure:**

- Identify true minimum viable product
- Plan parallel development streams where possible
- Consider team augmentation with contractors
- Evaluate scope reduction opportunities aggressively

**Timeline Pressure Analysis:**
