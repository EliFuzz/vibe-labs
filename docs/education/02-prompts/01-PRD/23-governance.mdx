## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Governance Pitfalls:

- **Over-governance**: Creating unnecessarily complex governance processes
- **Under-governance**: Not providing adequate oversight and control
- **Governance silos**: Not integrating governance across different domains
- **Static governance**: Not adapting governance as the system evolves

### Compliance Pitfalls:

- **Compliance theater**: Implementing controls that don't actually provide protection
- **Regulatory misunderstanding**: Misinterpreting regulatory requirements
- **Compliance debt**: Deferring compliance requirements to later phases
- **Audit unpreparedness**: Not preparing for compliance audits

## Edge Case Considerations

### When Regulations Conflict:

- Identify the most restrictive requirements
- Consult with legal experts for interpretation
- Plan for jurisdiction-specific implementations
- Document compliance approach clearly

### When Governance is Complex:

- Start with minimum viable governance
- Plan for governance evolution
- Focus on highest-risk areas first
- Build governance automation where possible
