### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overly Optimistic Timelines**: Failing to account for complexity, unknowns, and potential delays.
- **Resource Assumptions**: Assuming ideal team availability, productivity, and skill sets.
- **Scope Creep**: Not effectively managing changing requirements without adjusting the timeline or resources.
- **Dependency Neglect**: Underestimating the impact and complexity of internal and external dependencies.
- **Risk Blindness**: Not identifying, documenting, and planning for likely project risks.
- **Communication Gaps**: Poor or infrequent communication with stakeholders, leading to misalignment.
- **Quality Shortcuts**: Sacrificing testing and quality assurance for the sake of speed.
- **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Taking shortcuts during development that create long-term maintenance problems.
- **Team Burnout**: Setting an unsustainable pace and unrealistic expectations for the development team.
- **Launch Unpreparedness**: Insufficient preparation for the production environment, customer support, and monitoring.

### Edge Case Handling

- **Extreme Timeline Pressure**: Focus on a true Minimum Viable Product (MVP), identify scope reduction opportunities, consider parallel development streams, and plan for technical debt.
- **Complex Dependencies**: Create detailed dependency maps, build in extra buffers, develop contingency plans for failures, and establish clear communication with owners.
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize features, consider phased delivery for limited budgets, leverage automation for small teams, and plan for training/hiring to address skill gaps.
- **Technical Challenges**: Build prototypes for high-risk areas, allocate extra time for complex integrations, plan for rigorous performance/security testing, and design for scalability.
- **New/Distributed Teams**: Allocate extra time for team formation, communication setup, knowledge transfer, and consider pilot projects to validate estimates.
