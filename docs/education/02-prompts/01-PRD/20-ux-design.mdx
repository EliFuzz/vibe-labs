- **Accessibility as an Afterthought**: Adding accessibility features after core design, leading to reworks.
- **Mobile Neglect**: Designing for desktop first without sufficient mobile consideration.
- **Complexity Creep**: Adding unnecessary features and complexity without clear user value.
- **Skipping User Testing**: Not validating designs with real users.
- **Happy Path Only**: Not considering error scenarios and edge cases in user flows.
- **Vague Requirements**: Setting unmeasurable usability goals or unrealistic expectations.
- **Documentation Neglect**: Not properly documenting design decisions and guidelines.

### Edge Case Considerations

- **Diverse Abilities**: Plan comprehensive accessibility features, consider assistive technology compatibility, test with users with disabilities, and provide multiple ways to accomplish tasks.
- **Technical Constraints**: Work closely with the technical team to understand limitations, identify creative solutions within constraints, and plan UX improvements as technical debt is addressed. Document UX compromises.
- **Different Expertise Levels**: Design with progressive disclosure for complex features, provide multiple interaction paths, include contextual help, and plan for customizable interfaces.
- **Complex User Workflows**: Break down complex tasks into smaller steps, provide clear progress indicators, allow users to save progress, and design for both novice and expert users.
- **Performance Constraints**: Optimize images and media, provide meaningful loading states, design graceful degradation for older browsers, and consider offline functionality.
- **Internationalization**: Design for text expansion, right-to-left reading patterns, culturally appropriate elements, and different date/time/number formats.
