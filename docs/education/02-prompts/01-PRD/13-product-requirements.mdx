## Information Gathering Questions

If requirement details are missing, ask:

### Functional Requirements

1. What are the core user workflows and tasks?
2. What features are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?
3. How should users interact with the product?
4. What data does the product need to collect and process?

### Non-Functional Requirements

5. What are the performance expectations?
6. What security and privacy requirements exist?
7. What devices and browsers must be supported?
8. What accessibility requirements apply?

### Business Requirements

9. What business rules and policies must be enforced?
10. What regulatory compliance is required?
11. What are the budget and timeline constraints?
12. What integrations are required?

### Technical Requirements

13. What technical constraints exist?
14. What systems must the product integrate with?
15. What scalability requirements exist?
16. What development and deployment requirements apply?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Requirement Definition Pitfalls

- **Vague requirements**: Using ambiguous language that can be interpreted multiple ways
- **Solution-focused**: Describing how instead of what (requirements should be solution-agnostic)
- **Unmeasurable criteria**: Acceptance criteria that can't be objectively tested
- **Missing edge cases**: Failing to consider error conditions and unusual scenarios
- **Scope creep**: Adding requirements without proper evaluation and prioritization

### Prioritization Pitfalls

- **Everything is high priority**: Failing to make difficult prioritization decisions
- **Stakeholder bias**: Prioritizing based on who asks loudest rather than user value
- **Technical bias**: Prioritizing easy-to-build over high-value features
- **Feature factory**: Focusing on feature quantity over user outcomes
- **Ignoring constraints**: Prioritizing without considering resource limitations

## Edge Case Handling

### Conflicting Requirements

- Document the conflict clearly
- Identify stakeholders affected by each option
- Analyze trade-offs and implications
- Propose compromise solutions
- Escalate to decision-makers with recommendations

### Uncertain Requirements

- Mark requirements as assumptions
- Plan for validation through prototyping or user testing
- Create multiple requirement scenarios
- Build in flexibility for requirement changes
- Schedule regular requirement reviews

### Technical Constraints

- Work with technical teams to understand limitations
- Explore alternative approaches to meet user needs
- Consider phased implementation strategies
- Document technical debt and future improvement plans
- Balance ideal requirements with practical constraints

### Regulatory Requirements

- Consult with legal and compliance teams
- Research applicable regulations thoroughly
- Plan for regulatory approval processes
- Consider international regulatory variations
- Build compliance into core product design

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] **Completeness**: All necessary requirements identified
- [ ] **Clarity**: Requirements are unambiguous and specific
- [ ] **Testability**: Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] **Feasibility**: Requirements are technically achievable
