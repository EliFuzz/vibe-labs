## Information Gathering Requirements

### Risk Context Needed:

- Historical data on similar projects and their risks
- Team experience and capability assessment
- Market and competitive intelligence
- Technical complexity and dependency analysis
- Stakeholder risk tolerance and preferences

### Validation Requirements:

- Team review and validation of risk assessments
- Stakeholder alignment on risk priorities
- Expert review of technical and market risks
- Stress testing of mitigation strategies

## Cross-Reference Requirements

### Must Reference:

- All technical requirements and dependencies
- Timeline and resource constraints
- Success metrics and validation approach
- Market analysis and competitive landscape

### Must Support:

- Project planning and resource allocation
- Stakeholder communication and expectation setting
- Quality assurance and testing strategy
- Launch planning and go-to-market execution

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Risk Identification Pitfalls:

- **Optimism bias**: Underestimating likelihood or impact of risks
- **Scope limitation**: Only considering obvious or technical risks
- **Static thinking**: Not considering how risks evolve over time
- **Blame avoidance**: Not identifying risks due to fear of responsibility

### Risk Assessment Pitfalls:

- **Subjective assessment**: Not using consistent criteria for evaluation
- **Single point of view**: Not getting diverse perspectives on risks
- **Historical bias**: Over-relying on past experience without considering context
- **Impact underestimation**: Not fully considering cascading effects

### Mitigation Pitfalls:

- **Mitigation theater**: Creating mitigation plans that aren't actionable
- **Over-mitigation**: Spending too much effort on low-priority risks
- **No ownership**: Not assigning clear responsibility for mitigation
- **No monitoring**: Not tracking whether mitigation is working

## Edge Case Considerations

### When Risk Tolerance is Low:

- Focus on comprehensive mitigation for all identified risks
- Build extra buffers and contingencies
- Plan more frequent risk reviews and updates
- Consider more conservative technical and market approaches

### When Timeline Pressure is High:

- Focus mitigation on highest-impact risks
- Accept some risks in favor of speed
- Plan rapid response capabilities
- Communicate risk trade-offs clearly to stakeholders

### When Team is Inexperienced:

- Add extra focus on execution and process risks
- Plan for more mentoring and knowledge transfer
- Build in extra learning time and iteration cycles
- Consider external expertise for high-risk areas
