### Incident Response Pitfalls:

- **Unclear procedures**: Not having clear incident response procedures
- **Poor communication**: Not communicating effectively during incidents
- **Blame culture**: Focusing on blame instead of learning from incidents
- **No follow-up**: Not conducting post-incident reviews and improvements

## Edge Case Considerations

### When Team Lacks Operational Experience:

- Start with basic operational procedures and tools
- Plan for extensive training and mentoring
- Consider external operational consulting
- Build operational maturity gradually
