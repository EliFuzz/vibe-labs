## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Framework and Enhancements

Define a comprehensive Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) framework for enterprise-grade systems, outlining principles, practices, and organizational structure to ensure reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems. It also details the enhancements to the existing Product Requirements Document (PRD) system, moving it from 70% to 95% enterprise readiness through the integration of critical SRE and performance engineering components.

### 2. Service Level Management

**Objective**: Define a comprehensive framework for Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

**Required Elements**:

- **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**: Specific, measurable metrics that quantify service performance.
  - **Examples**:
    - API Service Availability: % of successful requests.

    - API Service Latency: <200ms (95th percentile) over 30 days.
    - Data Pipeline Freshness: <1 hour over 24 hours.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Customer-facing commitments that formalize the agreed-upon service levels and specify consequences for non-compliance (e.g., service credits).
  - **Examples**:
    - API Service: 99.5% availability, with service credits as consequences.
    - API Service: <500ms response time, with performance credits as consequences.
- **Error Budget Management**:
