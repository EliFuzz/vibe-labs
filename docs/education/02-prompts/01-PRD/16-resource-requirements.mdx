## Edge Case Considerations

### When Budget is Constrained:

- Prioritize essential resources and defer nice-to-haves
- Consider alternative sourcing strategies (contractors, offshore)
- Plan phased resource acquisition
- Identify cost optimization opportunities

### When Skills are Scarce:

- Plan longer lead times for hiring
- Consider training existing team members
- Evaluate external consulting options
- Plan knowledge transfer and documentation

### When Timeline is Aggressive:

- Consider parallel work streams with more resources
- Evaluate contractor and consulting augmentation
- Plan for potential resource conflicts and dependencies
- Build in resource buffers for critical path items
